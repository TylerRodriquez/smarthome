smartthings_radio_thermostat
============================

Allow smartthings to talk to a radio thermostat device.
You must set the following types for your device:

- Refresh 
- Temperature Measurement 
- Sensor 
- Thermostat
- Polling

Set the device network id to the IP address in hex (no spaces,dots,etc) with :0050 after.

For example: `0A010A14:0050` maps to: `10.1.10.20:80`
